With the increasing demand for electricity, efficient power consumption monitoring has become essential for reducing energy waste and lowering electricity bills. This project proposes an IoT-based power monitoring and optimization system that provides real-time insights into energy usage in a building and suggests energy-saving measures. The system integrates PZEM-004T (AC energy meter) and SCT-013 (current sensor) to measure voltage, current, power, and energy consumption. These sensors are connected to a microcontroller (ESP32/ESP8266/Arduino), which collects the data and transmits it to a cloud-based IoT platform (Blynk, Firebase, or ThingSpeak). Users can access real-time and historical energy consumption data via a mobile or web application. To enhance efficiency, a machine learning model analyzes past power usage patterns to detect anomalies and predict high-energy consumption trends. The system also generates real-time alerts when usage exceeds a set threshold and provides recommendations to optimize electricity consumption. By implementing this smart power monitoring system, users can gain better control over their energy usage, improve efficiency, reduce electricity costs, and contribute to environmental sustainability.
